# TGML

TGML stands for TAC Graphics Markup Language. It is the file format used for graphics pages.

From [File type advisor](https://www.filetypeadvisor.com/extension/tgml):

> The .tgml filename extension is associated with the TAC Graphics Markup Language (TGML) and denotes the TGML Graphic (.tgml) file fype.
> TGML is an XML-based markup language created by TAC (part of Schneider Electric) for describing dynamic vector-based graphics used in TAC Vista and TAC Xenta industrial engineering and automation systems.
> A .tgml file is a TAC tecnical vector drawing.
> It is a formal TGML document, in which XML syntax is used to describe the hierarchy, position/location, and interconnection of the contained graphic elements.
> Besides static components and blocks, a TGML graphic can contain or link to dynamic or interactive elements.
> Within a TAC Vista project, TGML graphic files are located inside the "[ProjectName]\Graphics" subdirectory (e.g., "C:\ProjectACME\Graphics").
> Any .tgml file can be directly opened for editing in the Graphics Editor for TGML, a dedicated commercial tool available from Schneider Electric for working with TGML graphics.
