From Alex:

sequence for valves difference between dead plant and 1 running chiller
for example open valve then start pump, vs start second pump before opening valve
separate out chw setpoint for each chiller
after each section say restore back to normal
at the beginning of each section record current setpoint
for chiller rotation your second should stage on with full sequence explanation, then lag chiller stages off
all timers at setpoints that are adjustable should have its own question and be flagged as an issue if missing

stage 2 to stage 1: stage down, chiller off, 5 min delay, valve shuts, pump off/ slows down then off
