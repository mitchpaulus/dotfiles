## IO

- Get command line arguments: `getArgs` from `System.Environment`
- Run external programs: `System.Process`

## Records

- data Record = Record { field :: Type, field2 :: Type }

- Update record field `variable { singleField = something }`


## Learning Monads

- ["What are Monads? Fallacy](https://two-wrongs.com/the-what-are-monads-fallacy)
    - Start by learning the usage of the `Maybe`, `Either`, `IO` monads,
      using `>>=` and `do` operator.

## 'as-patterns'

Can use an '@' symbol in pattern matching. [This is useful if you want
to "decompose" a parameter into it's parts while still needing the
parameter as a whole somewhere in your
function.](https://stackoverflow.com/a/1153609/5932184)

## Strings

Pretty much go to `Data.Text` right way when dealing with text.

```haskell
import qualified Data.Text as T
```

## Type Classes

Type classes are defined by specifying a set of function or constant names,
together with their respective types, that must exist for every type that belongs to the class.

```haskell
class Monad m where
  return :: a -> m a
  (>>=)  :: m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b
```

## Setup with Nix

## Cabal

Puts packages and binaries at `~/.cabal/`

## Stream Fusion

- Streams are what I think they are: linear access to a potentially unbounded list of data.
- General term for eliminating intermediate data structures that grow with stream processing is *deforestation*.
- In the context of stream processing, it's typically called *stream fusion*.
