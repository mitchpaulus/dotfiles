# `test`

For all of these, be sure to wrap variables in quotes, `test` without an
argument is always true.

From the fish man page:
> When  using a variable as an argument for a test operator you should almost always enclose it in double-quotes. There are only two
> situations it is safe to omit the quote marks. The first is when the argument is a literal string  with  no  whitespace  or  other
> characters  special  to the shell (e.g., semicolon). For example, test -b /my/file. The second is using a variable that expands to
> exactly one element including if that element is the empty string (e.g., set x ''). If the variable is not set, set  but  with  no
> value,  or set to more than one value you must enclose it in double-quotes. For example, test "$x" = "$y". Since it is always safe
> to enclose variables in double-quotes when used as test arguments that is the recommended practice.

 -b FILE returns true if FILE is a block device.
 -c FILE returns true if FILE is a character device.
 -d FILE returns true if FILE is a directory.
 -e FILE returns true if FILE exists.
 -f FILE returns true if FILE is a regular file.
 -g FILE returns true if FILE has the set-group-ID bit set.
 -G FILE returns true if FILE exists and has the same group ID as the current user.
 -k FILE returns true if FILE has the sticky bit set. If the  OS  does  not  support  the  concept  it  returns  false.  See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sticky_bit.
 -L FILE returns true if FILE is a symbolic link.
 -O FILE returns true if FILE exists and is owned by the current user.
 -p FILE returns true if FILE is a named pipe.
 -r FILE returns true if FILE is marked as readable.
 -s FILE returns true if the size of FILE is greater than zero.
 -S FILE returns true if FILE is a socket.
 -t FD returns true if the file descriptor FD is a terminal (TTY).
 -u FILE returns true if FILE has the set-user-ID bit set.
 -w FILE returns true if FILE is marked as writable; note that this does not check if the filesystem is read-only.
 -x FILE returns true if FILE is marked as executable.

OPERATORS FOR TEXT STRINGS
• STRING1 = STRING2 returns true if the strings STRING1 and STRING2 are identical.
• STRING1 != STRING2 returns true if the strings STRING1 and STRING2 are not identical.
• -n STRING returns true if the length of STRING is non-zero.
• -z STRING returns true if the length of STRING is zero.

OPERATORS TO COMPARE AND EXAMINE NUMBERS
• NUM1 -eq NUM2 returns true if NUM1 and NUM2 are numerically equal.
• NUM1 -ne NUM2 returns true if NUM1 and NUM2 are not numerically equal.
• NUM1 -gt NUM2 returns true if NUM1 is greater than NUM2.
• NUM1 -ge NUM2 returns true if NUM1 is greater than or equal to NUM2.
• NUM1 -lt NUM2 returns true if NUM1 is less than NUM2.
• NUM1 -le NUM2 returns true if NUM1 is less than or equal to NUM2.

Both integers and floating point numbers are supported.

OPERATORS TO COMBINE EXPRESSIONS
• COND1 -a COND2 returns true if both COND1 and COND2 are true.
• COND1 -o COND2 returns true if either COND1 or COND2 are true.

Expressions can be inverted using the ! operator:

• ! EXPRESSION returns true if EXPRESSION is false, and false if EXPRESSION is true.

Expressions can be grouped using parentheses.

• ( EXPRESSION ) returns the value of EXPRESSION.
  Note that parentheses will usually require escaping with \( to avoid being interpreted as a command substitution.
