# GIMP

## Filling area with transparency

Easiest way I've found is to use the "Fuzzy Select" Tool (Shortcut 'U').
Get selection, then click 'Delete'.

## Text Annotations

- GIMP isn't great at general annotation. There is no way to create a
  simple text box with a background color.

Quote from [Gimp Documentation](https://docs.gimp.org/en/gimp-using-rectangular.html)
"Gimp is not designed to be used for drawing"

## Move text layer

- In Text Tool, use ALT and click and drag
- In Move Tool, make sure text layer is selected, click right on the
  text.
