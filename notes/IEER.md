# IEER

Defined in AHRI Standard 340/360

𝐼𝐸𝐸𝑅 = (0.020 ∙ 𝐴)+ (0.617 ∙ 𝐵) + (0.238 ∙ 𝐶)+ (0.125 ∙ 𝐷) 3
Where:
A = EER, (Btu/h)/W, at 100% Capacity at AHRI Standard Rating Conditions (see Table 6)
B = EER, (Btu/h)/W, at 75% Capacity and reduced condenser temperature (see Table 9)
C = EER, (Btu/h)/W, at 50% Capacity and reduced condenser temperature (see Table 9)
D = EER, (Btu/h)/W, at 25% Capacity and reduced condenser temperature (see Table 9)
The IEER rating requires that the unit efficiency be determined at 100, 75, 50, and 25 Percent Load at the
conditions specified in Table 9 and at the part-load rated airflow, if different than the Full Load Rated Indoor
Airflow.

50 Percent Load = 57.5ºF/68.0ºF/77.0ºF
25 Percent Load = 52.8ºF/65.0ºF/77.0ºF

Notes:
1. Refer to Section 6.1.3 for indoor airflow and external static pressure.
2. Condenser airflow shall be adjusted, if required per Section 6.1.3.6 or 6.1.3.7.
3. At 100 Percent Load, the condenser water flow rate shall be equal to the flow rate determined for the Standard
Rating Condition for cooling, described in Table 6. Except as noted in Section E7, at 75, 50, and 25 Percent Load,
the supplemental testing instructions (10 CFR §429.43) shall describe the conditions to run the unit.
4. For testing Air-cooled units that reject condensate to the condenser coil, the condenser air wet bulb temperature
requirements specified for evaporatively cooled products apply.
5. For Single Package Units that do not reject condensate to the Outdoor Coil, where all or part of the indoor section of
the equipment is located in the outdoor room, maintain an outdoor room dew point temperature of 60.5ºF for 100,
75, and 50 Percent Load and 58.7°F for 25 Percent Load.
