## Extracting .dist backup files

1. Just rename as zip
2. `niagra_user_home/stations/{station}/config.bog` - zip file of the main object tree
3. `niagra_user_home/stations/{station}/shared/BCP/{num}/Project.gfx` - Programming

Old

~~1. Best way was to use `jar xvf file.dist`. Still failed at the end for missing end-of-file marker for zip, but did extract files along the way.~~
