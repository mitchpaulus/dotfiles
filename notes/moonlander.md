# Moonlander Keyboard Updates

- Remove the Left Ctrl from the bottom left corner of the keyboard. Not
  needed since the ctrl on the z key works pretty well, and can ctrl Z
  using the right cntl on the / key.

- Need way to do CTRL-F9 and other CTRL F key combinations

- Add Win+<Num> layer, so can quickly switch applications on Windows.
