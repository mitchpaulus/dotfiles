## Equation of Plane

A four number proportion.

Derive by:

1. Assuming point ($x_0$, $y_0$, and $z_0$) and a normal vector $<a, b, c>$.

$$
ax + by + cz = d
$$

## Arc Radius Formula

[Source](https://mathopenref.com/arcradiusderive.html)

Intersecting chord theorem

$$
a a = b c
$$

Since a is half the arc's width W, and b is its height H:

$$
\frac{W²}{4} = H * c
$$

Solve for c

$$
c = \frac{W²}{4 H}
$$

Diameter is $c + H$

$$
D = H + \frac{W²}{4 H}
$$

Divide both sides by 2 for radius

$$
R = H/2 + \frac{W²}{8 H}
$$
