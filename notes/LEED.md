Two items related to Cx

- Fundamental Cx and Verification - A prerequisite that is required.
- Enhanced Cx (3-4 points)

## Fundamental

Pg 321:

The Cx authority must:
- Review the OPR, BOD, and project design.
- Develop and implement a Cx plan.
- Confirm incorporation of Cx requirements into the construction documents.
- Develop construction checklists.
- Develop a system test procedure.
- Verify system test execution.
- Maintain an issues and benefits log throughout the Cx process.
- Prepare a final Cx process report.
- Document all findings and recommendations and report directly to the owner throughout the process

Current Facilities Requirements and Operations and Maintenance Plan

Prepare and maintain a current facilities requirements and operations and maintenance plan that contains the
information necessary to operate the building efficiently. The plan must include the following:
- a sequence of operations for the building;
- the building occupancy schedule;
- equipment run-time schedules;
- setpoints for all HVAC equipment;
- set lighting levels throughout the building;
- minimum outside air requirements;
- any changes in schedules or setpoints for different seasons, days of the week, and times of day;
- a systems narrative describing the mechanical and electrical systems and equipment;
- a preventive maintenance plan for building equipment described in the systems narrative; and
- a commissioning program that includes periodic commissioning requirements, ongoing commissioning tasks, and continuous tasks for critical facilities.

### Minimum Energy Performance/Optimize Energy Performance


For v4, compare to 90.1-2010


Modeling requirements (2010) Table G3.1:

1. Design model - Same as proposed design
2. Additions and Alterations - Same as proposed design
3. Space Use Classification - Same as proposed design
4. Schedules - Same as proposed design
5. Building Envelope
  - Orientation:
    The baseline building performance shall be generated by simulating the building with its actual orientation
    and again after rotating the entire building 90, 180, and 270 degrees, and then averaging the results.
  - Opaque assemblies
    Match Tables 5.5-1 through 5.5-8.
  - Vertical Fenestration
    Same as proposed or 40% of area, whichever is smaller.
6. Lighting
  - Same category, max value in 9.2.
7. Thermal Block - HVAC Zones Designed
  - To combine zones must:
    - The space sue classification is the same throughout the thermal block
    - All HVAC zones in the thermal block that are adjacent to glazed exterior walls face the same orientation or their orientations vary by less than 45Â°
    - All of the zones are served by the same HVAC system or by the same kind of HVAC system.
8. Thermal Blocks - HVAC Zones Not Designed
  - ...
9. Thermal Blocks - Multifamily Residential Buildings
10. HVAC Systems
  - The HVAC systems in the baseline building design shall be of the type and description specified in Section G3.1.1,
    shall meet the  general HVAC system requirements specified in Section G3.1.2,
    and shall meet any system-specific requirements in Section G3.1.3 that are applicable to the baseline HVAC system types
