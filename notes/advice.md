• That thing that made you weird as a kid could make you great as an
adult — if you don’t lose it.

• If you have any doubt at all about being able to carry a load in one
trip, do yourself a huge favor and make two trips.

• What you get by achieving your goals is not as important as what you
become by achieving your goals. At your funeral people will not recall
what you did; they will only remember how you made them feel.

• Recipe for success: under-promise and over-deliver.

• It’s not an apology if it comes with an excuse. It is not a compliment
if it comes with a request.

• Jesus, Superman, and Mother Teresa never made art. Only imperfect
beings can make art because art begins in what is broken.

• If someone is trying to convince you it’s not a pyramid scheme, it’s a
pyramid scheme.

• Learn how to tie a bowline knot. Practice in the dark. With one hand.
For the rest of your life you’ll use this knot more times than you would
ever believe.

failure.

• Be governed not by the tyranny of the urgent but by the elevation of
the important.

• Leave a gate behind you the way you first found it.

name for. If you possibly can, work where there are no words for what
you do.

• A balcony or porch needs to be at least 6 feet (2m) deep or it won’t
be used.

• Don’t create things to make money; make money so you can create
things. The reward for good work is more work.

• In all things — except love — start with the exit strategy. Prepare
for the ending. Almost anything is easier to get into than out of.

• Train employees well enough they could get another job, but treat them
well enough so they never want to.

• Don’t aim to have others like you; aim to have them respect you.

• The foundation of maturity: Just because it’s not your fault doesn’t
mean it’s not your responsibility.

• A multitude of bad ideas is necessary for one good idea.

• Being wise means having more questions than answers.

• Compliment people behind their back. It’ll come back to you.

• Most overnight successes — in fact any significant successes — take at
least 5 years. Budget your life accordingly.

• You are only as young as the last time you changed your mind.

• Assume anyone asking for your account information for any reason is
guilty of scamming you, unless proven innocent. The way to prove
innocence is to call them back, or login to your account using numbers
or a website that you provide, not them. Don’t release any identifying
information while they are contacting you via phone, message or email.
You must control the channel.

• Sustained outrage makes you stupid.

• Be strict with yourself and forgiving of others. The reverse is hell
for everyone.

• Your best response to an insult is “You’re probably right.” Often they
are.

• The worst evils in history have always been committed by those who
truly believed they were combating evil. Beware of combating evil.

• If you can avoid seeking approval of others, your power is limitless.

• When a child asks an endless string of “why?” questions, the smartest
reply is, “I don’t know, what do you think?”

• To be wealthy, accumulate all those things that money can’t buy.

• Be the change you wish to see.

• When brainstorming, improvising, jamming with others, you’ll go much
further and deeper if you build upon each contribution with a playful
“yes — and” example instead of a deflating “no — but” reply.

• Work to become, not to acquire.

• Don’t loan money to a friend unless you are ready to make it a gift.

• On the way to a grand goal, celebrate the smallest victories as if
each one were the final goal. No matter where it ends you are
victorious.

• Calm is contagious.

• Even a foolish person can still be right about most things. Most
conventional wisdom is true.

• Always cut away from yourself.

• Show me your calendar and I will tell you your priorities. Tell me who
your friends are, and I’ll tell you where you’re going.

• When hitchhiking, look like the person you want to pick you up.

• Contemplating the weaknesses of others is easy; contemplating the
weaknesses in yourself is hard, but it pays a much higher reward.

• Worth repeating: measure twice, cut once.

• Your passion in life should fit you exactly; but your purpose in life
should exceed you. Work for something much larger than yourself.

• If you can’t tell what you desperately need, it’s probably sleep.

• When playing Monopoly, spend all you have to buy, barter, or trade for
the Orange properties. Don’t bother with Utilities.

• If you borrow something, try to return it in better shape than you
received it. Clean it, sharpen it, fill it up.

• Even in the tropics it gets colder at night than you think. Pack
warmly.

• To quiet a crowd or a drunk, just whisper.

• Writing down one thing you are grateful for each day is the cheapest
possible therapy ever.

• When someone tells you something is wrong, they’re usually right. When
someone tells you how to fix it, they’re usually wrong.

• If you think you saw a mouse, you did. And, if there is one, there are
more.

• Money is overrated. Truly new things rarely need an abundance of
money. If that was so, billionaires would have a monopoly on inventing
new things, and they don’t. Instead almost all breakthroughs are made by
those who lack money, because they are forced to rely on their passion,
persistence and ingenuity to figure out new ways. Being poor is an
advantage in innovation.

• Ignore what others may be thinking of you, because they aren’t.

• Avoid hitting the snooze button. That’s just training you to
oversleep.

• Always say less than necessary.

• You are given the gift of life in order to discover what your gift
*in* life is. You will complete your mission when you figure out what
your mission is. This is not a paradox. This is the way.

• Don’t treat people as bad as they are. Treat them as good as you are.

• It is much easier to change how you think by changing your behavior,
than it is to change your behavior by changing how you think. Act out
the change you seek.

• You can eat any dessert you want if you take only 3 bites.

• Each time you reach out to people, bring them a blessing; then they’ll
be happy to see you when you bring them a problem.

• Bad things can happen fast, but almost all good things happen slowly.

• Don’t worry how or where you begin. As long as you keep moving, your
success will be far from where you start.

• When you confront a stuck bolt or screw: righty tighty, lefty loosey.

• If you meet a jerk, overlook them. If you meet jerks everywhere
everyday, look deeper into yourself.

• Dance with your hips.

• We are not bodies that temporarily have souls. We are souls that
temporarily have bodies.

• You can reduce the annoyance of someone’s stupid belief by increasing
your understanding of why they believe it.

• If your goal does not have a schedule, it is a dream.

• All the greatest gains in life — in wealth, relationships, or
knowledge —come from the magic of compounding interest — amplifying
small steady gains. All you need for abundance is to keep adding 1% more
than you subtract on a regular basis.

• The greatest breakthroughs are missed because they look like hard
work.

• People can’t remember more than 3 points from a speech.

• I have never met a person I admired who did not read more books than I
did.

• The greatest teacher is called “doing”.

• Finite games are played to win or lose. Infinite games are played to
keep the game going. Seek out infinite games because they yield infinite
rewards.

• Everything is hard before it is easy. The day before something is a
breakthrough, it’s a stupid idea.

• A problem that can be solved with money is not really a problem.

• When you are stuck, sleep on it. Let your subconscious work for you.

• Your work will be endless, but your time is finite. You cannot limit
the work so you must limit your time. Hours are the only thing you can
manage.

• To succeed, get other people to pay you; to become wealthy, help other
people to succeed.

• Children totally accept — and crave — family rules. “In our family we
have a rule for X” is the only excuse a parent needs for setting a
family policy. In fact, “I have a rule for X” is the only excuse you
need for your own personal policies.

• All guns are loaded.

• Many backward steps are made by standing still.

• This is the best time ever to make something. None of the greatest,
coolest creations 20 years from now have been invented yet. You are not
late.

• No rain, no rainbow.

• Every person you meet knows an amazing lot about something you know
virtually nothing about. Your job is to discover what it is, and it
won’t be obvious.

• You don’t marry a person, you marry a family.

• Always give credit, take blame.

• Be frugal in all things, except in your passions splurge.

• When making something, always get a few extras — extra material, extra
parts, extra space, extra finishes. The extras serve as backups for
mistakes, reduce stress, and fill your inventory for the future. They
are the cheapest insurance.

• Something does not need to be perfect to be wonderful. Especially
weddings.

• Don’t let your email inbox become your to-do list.

• The best way to untangle a knotty tangle is not to “untie” the knots,
but to keep pulling the loops apart wider and wider. Just make the mess
as big, loose and open as possible. As you open up the knots they will
unravel themselves. Works on cords, strings, hoses, yarns, or electronic
cables.

• Be a good ancestor. Do something a future generation will thank you
for. A simple thing is to plant a tree.

• To combat an adversary, become their friend.

• Take one simple thing — almost anything — but take it extremely
seriously, as if it was the only thing in the world, or maybe the entire
world is in it — and by taking it seriously you’ll light up the sky.

• History teaches us that in 100 years from now some of the assumptions
you believed will turn out to be wrong. A good question to ask yourself
today is “What might I be wrong about?”

• Be nice to your children because they are going to choose your nursing
home.

• Advice like these are not laws. They are like hats. If one doesn’t
fit, try another.
