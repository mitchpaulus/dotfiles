# Dimensions

- Manually modify dimension text: Tools -> Modify -> Properties (`mp` command).
  *Then* click on dimension.

To move position of dimensions:
1. Place your curser on the dimension line and left mouse click once.
2. Note: that the line turns to a red broken (dotted) linetype to show that it is selected.
   Also note a blue point by one of the dimension arrows.
3. Touch your curser to the blue point and hold down your left mouse button.
   Keep the button held down and move mouse and you will see the dimension move with the curser.
   Move the dimension to where you want it and left click to set the new position.
4. If you are satisfied with the dimension new position then right click twice to come out of the command.
   Otherwise grab the blue point again and move it where you want it. Then left mouse click once and right click twice.
5. Click on the line once to deselect it; the line changes from red back to white
