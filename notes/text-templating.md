# Text Templating

From <https://stackoverflow.com/a/65596807/5932184>, for .NET:

There are plenty of HTML Template engines/generators.

Just pick any depending on your needs.

Good luck.

- <https://github.com/dotliquid/dotliquid> (**DotLiquid** is a .Net port
  of the popular Ruby Liquid templating language. It is a separate
  project that aims to retain the same template syntax as the original,
  while using .NET coding conventions where possible)
- <https://github.com/StubbleOrg/Stubble> (**Stubble** trimmed down
  {{mustache}} templates in .NET is an implementation of the Mustache
  template system in C#)
- <https://github.com/scriban/scriban> (**Scriban** is a fast, powerful,
  safe and lightweight scripting language and engine for .NET, which was
  primarily developed for text templating with a compatibility mode for
  parsing liquid templates)
- <https://github.com/sebastienros/fluid> (**Fluid** is an open-source
  .NET template engine that is as close as possible to the Liquid
  template language. It's a secure template language that is also very
  accessible for non-programmer audiences. It also contains an ASP.NET
  Core MVC View Engine)
- <https://github.com/jdiamond/Nustache> (**Nustache** - Logic-less
  templates for .NET)
- <https://github.com/Handlebars-Net/Handlebars.Net> (**Handlebars**.js is
  an extension to the Mustache templating language created by Chris
  Wanstrath. Handlebars.js and Mustache are both logicless templating
  languages that keep the view and the code separated like we all know
  they should be)
- <https://github.com/Antaris/RazorEngine> (**RazorEngine** is a
  templating engine built on Microsoft's Razor parsing engine,
  RazorEngine allows you to use Razor syntax to build dynamic
  templates.)
