# Interesting programming languages

## [Mercury](https://www.mercurylang.org/about.html)

"Logic" Programming language. Functional

## [Janet](https://janet-lang.org/)

Janet is a functional and imperative programming language.

- Lisp like
- dynamic
- Good for embedding

## [Unison](https://www.unisonweb.org/)

- Functional, code is content addressed.

## [The next great functional language](https://www.slideshare.net/jdegoes/the-next-great-functional-programming-language)

Not really a language, but features that are pretty cool.

## [murex shell](https://murex.rocks/)

A better bash with types?

## [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/)

A functional programming language targeted at HTML frontends.

## [V](https://vlang.io/)

Meant to be simple and compile fast.

## [Kitten](https://kittenlang.org/)

Kitten is a statically typed, stack-based functional programming
language designed to be simple and fast. It is a concatenative language,
combining aspects of imperative and pure functional programming.

## [Lux](https://github.com/LuxLang/lux)

Functional, statically typed, compiles to JVM, JavaScript, Python, Lua, or Ruby

The language is mostly inspired by the following 3 languages:

- Clojure (syntax, overall look & feel)
- Haskell (functional programming)
- Standard ML (module system)

## [Futhark](https://futhark-lang.org/)

Futhark is a small programming language designed to be compiled to efficient parallel code.

## [F\*](http://www.fstar-lang.org/)

F\* (pronounced F star) is a general-purpose functional programming language with effects aimed at program verification.

## [Languages ranked by expressiveness](https://redmonk.com/dberkholz/2013/03/25/programming-languages-ranked-by-expressiveness/)

Nice post trying to empirically determine which languages are more *expressive* than others.

## Hazel

Live functional programming environment featuring "typed holes". <https://hazel.org/>

See presentation at: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkDSL0U9ndQ&t=1s>

## Shen

<https://shenlanguage.org/index.html>. Functional LISP like language.
Interesting author: <https://www.marktarver.com/index.htm>.

## [Frink](https://frinklang.org/)

Programming language for physical calculations. Written by Alan Eliasen.
Deployed as single, dependency-free jar file.
[Frink Syntax Highlighting](https://github.com/ccraciun/frink.vim).
Maybe build a simpler syntax on top?

## [OK?](https://github.com/jesseduffield/OK)

Some very interesting compiler enforced design decisions for thought, even though it is a joke.

  - Only one comparer `>=`
    - a >= b => a >= b
    - a <= b => b >= a
    - a > b => !(a >= b)
    - a < b => !(b >= a)
    - a == b => x = a >= b; y = b >= a; x && y
    - a != b => x = !(a >= b); y = !(b >= a); x || y
  - No if statement, only switch

## [Nickel](https://github.com/tweag/nickel)

One of a few "configuration" programming languages.

Others to look into:

- CUE
- Jsonnet
- Nix
- Starlark

## [Nimble](http://was.tl/projects/nimble/)

Markdown with macros? Only outputs to HTML for now.

## [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/reference/1.9/index.html)

## [Lush](https://lush.sourceforge.net/index.html)

## [Flix](https://flix.dev/)

## [Factor](https://factorcode.org/littledan/dls.pdf)

## [Red](https://www.red-lang.org/)

## [Rebol](https://www.rebol.com/)
