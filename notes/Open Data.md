[5 Star Open Data](https://5stardata.info/en/)

Idea from Tim Berners-Lee.

1. make your stuff available on the Web (whatever format) under an open license
2. make it available as structured data (e.g., Excel instead of image scan of a table)
3. make it available in a non-proprietary open format (e.g., CSV instead of Excel)
4. use URIs to denote things, so that people can point at your stuff
5. link your data to other data to provide context
