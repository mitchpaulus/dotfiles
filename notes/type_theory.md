# Type Theory

## Algebraic Types

1. Product Types == Tuples, Records.           data Type = Type { field1 :: Type2, field2 :: Type2 }
2. Sum Types == Coproduct == Disjoint Unions.  data Type = Either | Or

Typically denote things as

Term: Type

Types are typically thought of as set of values that a term might evaluate to.

When dealing with generic types we come up across different
situations for dealing with derived types.

**Covariant**:

A generic class MyCovGen[T, ...] is called covariant in type variable T if MyCovGen[B, ...] is always a subtype of MyCovGen[A, ...].

**Contravariant**:

A generic class MyContraGen[T, ...] is called contravariant in type variable T if MyContraGen[A, ...] is always a subtype of MyContraGen[B, ...].

**Invariant**:

If neither of the above is true.

From plain English post:

 - `f` is covariant if A<=B implies that f(A) <= f(B)
 - `f` is contravariant if A<=B implies that f(B) <= f(A)
 - `f` is invariant if neither holds

Good comment [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/42720468/5932184):

> The real answer has to do with the way function types interact with subtyping.
> The short story is if a type parameter is used as a return type, it is covariant.
> On the other hand, if a type parameter is used as an argument type, it is contravariant.
> If it is used both as a return type and as an argument type, it is invariant.

## Dependent Types

Dependent types allow you to parameterize a type from a value. For
example (<https://stackoverflow.com/a/9374698/5932184>):

```
type BoundedInt(n) = { i:Int | i <= n }
```

## Hindley/Milner type system

Widely accepted approach for "parametric polymorphism", which is when a
function is defined over multiple types, acting in the *same way* for
each type.

This is in contrast to "ad hoc polymorphism", in which functions can act
*differently* for each type. See '[Ad hoc polymorphism](https://doi.org/10.1145/75277.75283)'.
