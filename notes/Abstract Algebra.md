# Abstract Algebra

- Groups have 4 axioms:
  - Closure: For any two elements in the group, their product (the result of applying the binary operation, usually called multiplication) is also in the group.
  - Associativity: The order in which the binary operation is applied does not matter.
  - Identity element: There exists an element in the group such that when it is multiplied with any other element, the result is that other element.
    This element is called the identity element and is usually denoted by the symbol "e".
  - Inverse element: For every element in the group, there exists another element (called its inverse) such that when the two elements are multiplied together, the result is the identity element.

- Fields
  - Group axioms for both multiplication and addition
  - Commutativity for both multiplication and addition
  - Distributivity: For any three elements a, b, and c in F, a(b + c) = ab + ac and (a + b)c = ac + bc.

From ChatGPT: Sure, here's a shorter jingle to remember the axioms for a field:

Add and multiply go hand in hand,
Associative, commutative, understand,
Zero and one, identity is grand,
Inverse and distributive complete the band.
