# Email

## Schema.org

You can add special interaction with the email client in Gmail (and Outlook too I think) using special syntax from Schema.org.

Example from GitHub:

```
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8"><p></p>
<p>Sample issue </p>

<p
style="font-size:small;-webkit-text-size-adjust:none;color:#666;">â€”<br>You
are receiving this because you authored the thread.<br>Reply to this
email directly, <a href="https://SampleDomainissues/1">view it on GitHub Enterprise</a>, or <a href="https://github.tamu.edu/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AAAAAZAYLV5CNE4I4XZVBELTJQ3BXANCNFSM3PDG">unsubscribe</a>.

## Content Types

multipart/alternative	Different representations of the same content	Show one (usually HTML)
multipart/mixed	Bundle of unrelated parts	Show all, offer downloads
multipart/related	Related parts for rendering together (e.g. inline images)	Render as a unit (HTML + resources)

From <https://mimekit.net/docs/html/Frequently-Asked-Questions.htm>

MIME is a tree structure of parts.
There are multiparts which contain other parts (even other multiparts).
There are message parts which contain messages. And finally, there are leaf-node parts which contain content.

There are a few common message structures:

The message contains only a text/plain or text/html part (easy, just use that).

The message contains a multipart/alternative which will typically look a bit like this:

multipart/alternative
  text/plain
  text/html

Same as above, but the html part is inside a multipart/related so that it can embed images:

multipart/alternative
  text/plain
  multipart/related
    text/html
    image/jpeg
    image/png

The message contains a textual body part as well as some attachments:

multipart/mixed
  text/plain
  application/octet-stream
  application/zip

The same as above, but with the first part replaced with either #2 or #3 To illustrate:

multipart/mixed
  multipart/alternative
    text/plain
    text/html
  application/octet-stream
  application/zip

Or:

multipart/mixed
  multipart/alternative
    text/plain
    multipart/related
      text/html
      image/jpeg
      image/png
  application/octet-stream
  application/zip
