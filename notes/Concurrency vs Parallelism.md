<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1050222/what-is-the-difference-between-concurrency-and-parallelism>

I like the explanations:

Concurrency: Interruptability
Parallelism: Independence

Concurrency: A property of a program or system
Parallelism: The run time behavior of running multiple tasks at the same time
