There are no `Branch` objects on the demand side of an AirLoop.

For a typical single duct air system there will be one
`AirLoopHVAC:SupplyPath` and one `AirLoopHVAC:ReturnPath`. A typical dual
duct system would have 2 `AirLoopHVAC:SupplyPaths` one for the hot air and
one for the cold air and 1 `AirLoopHVAC:ReturnPath`.
