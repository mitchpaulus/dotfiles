Interesting project, that builds on previous work.

Many new build systems stem from post written by D.J. Bernstein. Has
interesting website at
[https://cr.yp.to/djb.html](https://cr.yp.to/djb.html). The particular
page that led to a few new systems is

Here's the link that sent me down the new build programs path:
