Interesting project, that builds on previous work.

Many new build systems stem from post written by D.J. Bernstein.
Has interesting website at [https://cr.yp.to/djb.html](https://cr.yp.to/djb.html).
The particular page that led to a few new systems is [https://cr.yp.to/redo.html](https://cr.yp.to/redo.html).

Here's the link that sent me down the new build programs path:
