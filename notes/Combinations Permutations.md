# Combinations/Permutations

n = number of items
r = number of selections

Permutations with Repetition (order matters, repeats):  n^r
Permutations with no Repetitions (order matters, no repeat): n! / (n-r)! = n (n-1) (n-2) ... (n-r+1)
Combinations with Repetition (order doesn't matter, repeats): (r + n - 1)! / r! (n-1)!
Combinations with no Repetition (order doesn't matter, no repeat):  n! / r! (n-r)!
