# Psychrometrics

W = X Pv / (P - Pv)

or

Pv =  P W / (W + X)

X = 0.621945

## Low Temperature Psychrometrics

The triple point of water is at 0.01째C.
For temperatures far below freezing, the water can typically be in one of two states: vapor or solid.
So instead of a dew-point temperature, you really have a ["frost-point" temperature](https://pdhonline.com/courses/m135/m135content.pdf).

Also from that source:

> Special care must be taken when using a wet-bulb thermometer in near freezing conditions.
> At temperatures below 32째F, touch the wick with a piece of clean ice or another cold object to induce freezing,
> because distilled water can be cooled below 32째F without freezing.
> The psychrometric chart must use frost-bulb, not wet-bulb temperatures, below 32째F to be accurate with this method.
