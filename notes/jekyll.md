# Jekyll

Starting to get annoyed that every time I come back to my website I
can't built it because of some Ruby issue. But here are the basic
installation steps.

1. Install Ruby with required dependencies

  - On Arch,

    ```
    sudo pacman -S ruby base-devel
    ```

2. Set local gem location in environment variables, gem install
   `jekyll` and `bundler`.
