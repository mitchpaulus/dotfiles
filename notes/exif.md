## Tags

`DateTimeOriginal`: This seems to a be good one to set to mark when the photo was taken.
Has the exact form:

YYYY:MM:DD HH:MM:SS

Believe that this should be in the local time of location that the photo was taken in.

Based on this [Stack Overflow answer](https://photo.stackexchange.com/a/69193),
`DateTimeOriginal` is the tag that Windows gives the highest priority to.

## Exiftool

- Package on Arch/Manjaro is: perl-image-exiftool.
