The page range is a set of numbers separated by commas, ranges of
numbers separated dashes, or combinations of those.  The character
"z" represents the last page.  A number preceded by an "r" indicates
to count from the end, so "r3-r1" would be the last three pages of the
document.  Pages can appear in any order.  Ranges can appear with a
high number followed by a low number, which causes the pages to appear in
reverse.  Numbers may be repeated.  A page range may be appended with :odd
to indicate odd pages in the selected range or :even to indicate even
pages.' wl 0 exit
