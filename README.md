Always a work in progress.

## Programs I like to use

* EDITOR: ~~Vim~~Neovim, I've made the switch.

* TERMINAL: Alacritty for the most part on Linux. Windows Terminal in
  WSL.

* SHELL: Bash, default shell. Though looking into zsh.

* BROWSER: Firefox, It's not Google Chrome and works pretty well with vim-vixen
  extension.

* FONT: Fira Code, Monospaced font with fancy programming ligatures.

* PDF: Zathura, PDF viewing.

* Compton, compositor for transparency, etc.

* i3-blocks, Status bar for i3

* Ranger, for file browsing/navigation.

* tmux, When i3 isn't possible, like when I'm working in WSL on Windows
