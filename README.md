# Mitch Paulus dotfiles [![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/d50e331067be47ab8246b76686ff17c8)](https://www.codacy.com/manual/mitchpaulus/dotfiles?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=mitchpaulus/dotfiles&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

As they say, progress not perfection.

## Using

* OS: Little of everything, one [Arch](https://archlinux.org/),
  one [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/), two Windows.
  Looking into [NixOS](https://nixos.org/).

* EDITOR: ~~Vim~~ [Neovim](https://neovim.io), I've made the switch.

* TERMINAL: [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) or [Konsole](https://konsole.kde.org/) for the most part on Linux.
  [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/Microsoft/Terminal) in WSL.

* SHELL: [`fish`](https://fishshell.com/). So much more pleasant to work in on a daily basis.
  Also dogfooding my own shell [mshell](https://github.com/mitchpaulus/mshell) which I also do like a lot because I made it that way.
  ~~Bash, default shell. Though looking into zsh~~.

* BROWSER: Firefox, It's not Google Chrome and works pretty well with vim-vixen extension.

* FONT: [Iosevka](https://typeof.net/Iosevka/). Otherwise, Fira Code, Monospaced font with fancy programming ligatures.

* PDF: Zathura, PDF viewing. Okular on Manjaro. Bluebeam for work.

* COMPOSITOR: Compton, for transparency, etc.

* WM: Have KDE plasma on one computer, i3 on another, and WSL on Windows at main work. Often, `tmux` within a terminal.

* FILE MANAGER: [`lf`](https://github.com/gokcehan/lf).
